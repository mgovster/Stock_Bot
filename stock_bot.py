"""
This bot will day trade a select amount of stocks

Using Alpaca API
-might include webscraping with selenium and yahoo finance to make it so it searches through stocks
-later will make a crypto bot to day trade more often
-will include machine learning in this too
-will have some calculations in cpython (maybe in c++ with dll ill decide after)

TODO:
-have a instant stop for when day lost 10% of earnings (just in case bad market)
-bot to run until the market closes, and then it will stop and report earnings or losses (total for today)
-bot will take in stream of data with sockets
-???
-profit
